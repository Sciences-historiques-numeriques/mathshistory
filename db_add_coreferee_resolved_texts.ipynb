    "#txt = \"We have quoted above from Biancani concerning his high regard for Galileo. However, he did not always agree with Galileo's views. The first disagreement came in 1611 and concerned the mountains on the moon. Galileo had observed the surface of the moon through a telescope in 1609 and had used certain mathematical techniques to prove that there were lunar mountains. His claim appeared in Sidereus Nuncius published in May 1610. In May 1611 a group of scientists, mostly Jesuits, was brought together by cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga in Mantua to discuss Galileo's claims. One of the major points discussed was Galileo's proof that there were mountains on the moon, and the report from the group came down firmly in favour of the traditional belief that the moon was perfectly smooth. Galileo suspected that Biancani was the author of the report and letters were exchanged in which Biancani dissociated himself from any insult towards Galileo saying that he was sorry if he had been offended but, nevertheless, pointing out that he did believe that the moon was perfectly smooth. He also disagreed with Galileo in 1613 when a dispute broke out between Galileo and Christoph Scheiner over sunspots. Galileo unfairly accused Scheiner of plagiarism but, although Scheiner's discovery of sunspots was certainly independent of any work by Galileo, his explanation was quite wrong. Biancani, however, defended his fellow Jesuit Scheiner.\""
