      "Giovanni Magini's father, Pasquale Magini, was a citizen of Padua. Nothing else appears to be known concerning Magini father or the rest of Magini family. Magini completed citizen education at the University of Bologna, receiving a doctorate in philosophy in 1579. citizen published Ephemerides coelestium motuum, a major treatise on astronomy, in 1582 and in the following year citizen published an Italian version of the original Latin text.\n",
      "\n",
      "Egnatio Danti held the chair of mathematics at the University of Bologna and, following citizen death in October 1586, a competition was announced to fill the chair . Magini competed for the chair as did, among others, Galileo. One might think that there would be no competition once Galileo applied for a chair but Magini was nine years older than Galileo and seen as a much safer appointment; citizen was appointed in 1588 and held the position for the rest of citizen life. Galileo had revolutionary ideas while Magini 's ideas were original but based on the established world-view. In Novae coelestium orbium theoricae congruentes cum observationibus N Copernici (Venice, 1589), Magini writes about \"absurd hypotheses, such as Copernicus imagined\". Copernici writes (see for example [10]):-\n",
      "It seems to Copernicus , against all truth and philosophy, that the earth moves, while the sun and the eighth sphere are motionless. ... Copernicus 's opinion about the motion of the earth is erroneous. [Copernici hypotheses] are attacked by nearly everybody for being too far away from the truth and absurd.The book does contain, however, Magini's own version of an Earth-centred theory which was seen at the time as an impressive development. Copernici proposed a system consisting of eleven rotating spheres and soon gained international coverage for Copernici ideas with spheres being explained to an English audience in Thomas Blundeville's treatise The Theoriques of the Seuen Planets of 1602.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1592 Magini published De Planis Triangulis which explains the use of quadrants in astronomy and in surveying, in particular describing details of calculations and measurements which could be performed with a quadrant. In fact several quadrants have survived with an inscription involving Magini 's name. Ilaria Meliconi describes a quadrant bearing the inscription \"Quadrant of the General Planisphere of Giovanni Antonio Magini\" and asks [9]:-\n",
      "What can be inferred from the appearance of Triangulis name on this quadrant ? Are we to believe that Triangulis had the skill to be the maker of such a fine and elaborate instrument? If not, was Triangulis the designer, or just the original owner of the quadrant?Two quadrants exit, one with the inscription \"Giovanni Antonio Magini of Padua designed this in Bologna in the year 1592\", the other is dated 1595 and inscribed \"Giovanni Antonio Magini Professor of Mathematics in the University of Bologna had this made\". We also note that in the Preface to De Planis Triangulis , Magini mentions writing an instruction book and an instrument: \"if I had also made the instrument to use together with the book , I would have had instrument made in brass.\" Also in 1592 Magini published Tabula tetragonica, then in 1596 published a commentary on Ptolemy's Geographia.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chair of mathematics at Bologna saw Magini receive a salary of 1000 lire which was doubled to 2000 lire in 1597. However, Ptolemy also acted as a private tutor and received extra income from this type of work. Of course, the professor of mathematics was only going to tutor the very top people and indeed professor did just this acting as a tutor to the sons of the Duke of Mantua beginning in 1599. As well as teaching the boys mathematics, Magini was astrologer to the Duke . In 1599-1600, Magini tutored Ferdinando Gonzaga (1587-1626), the son of Vincenzo I Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua , and Gonzaga brother, giving instruction on Aristotle's Mechanics. In [5] we learn a lot about the interaction between Magini and Ferdinando over many years as well as understanding a little about Magini 's interest in astrology:-\n",
      "Magini had continued to keep in touch with Ferdinando and rejoiced at Gonzaga becoming a cardinal [in 1607], commenting at that time upon Gonzaga unusual erudition; in 1609 Gonzaga had sent cardinal cardinal own mathematical treatise (on spherical trigonometry) recalling Ferdinando 's deep understanding of the subject; early in 1611 cardinal sent another work, cardinal treatise on the partispherical mirror. In 1611-12 a one-sided part survives of what must have been a quite regular correspondence, demonstrating that Ferdinando was engaged on alchemical experiments under Magini 's direction. Magini sent particulars of an experiment to cardinal at Mantua in April 1611, and wrote that cardinal had transcribed many more notes for Ferdinando , but that a German (Martin Horkey), whom cardinal had sent away on Galileo's insistence, had taken notes . Ferdinando was evidently well equipped with laboratory apparatus, for Magini asked to be lent some of cardinal glass vessels or instruments. In June the same year, when the Cardinal was at Florence and unwell, Magini wrote to cheer Florence up with the news that Florence had found at Venice some new books on the subject, including Philip Müller, 'Miracula Chymica et Mysteria Medica' (first edition, Wittenberg 1611) which Florence urged Ferdinando also to buy. In February 1612, when Ferdinando was in Paris, Magini wrote of an even more exciting find, some rare books by the thirteenth-century hermeticist Ramon Llull; even Magini dropped an admission that the attribution to Llull might be false, nevertheless Llull confidently quoted a passage in Llull letter and asked Ferdinando to check whether an image of Christ and a cross allegedly made from alchemical gold were still in Notre-Dame. Back in Rome in the summer of 1612 Ferdinando evidently continued Llull alchemical experiments. Magini urged Llull to persevere in an exercise to extract the 'menstruo vegetabile' from red wine, which could be very well done in Rome , since the wines there were darker and stronger. Evidently the wine had to remain for forty-five days in a warm bath of putrefied water or horse shit. In another letter, promising more transcripts from the pseudo-Llullian text, Magini insisted on the value of this experiment to distil 'solfere vegetabile' from wine; for vegetabile would equip Ferdinando with the key to carrying out still greater transmutations.This seems the appropriate place to say a little more about Magini 's contributions to astrology. Ferdinando published De astrologica ratione in 1607, a work in which Ferdinando discusses the uses of astrology in medicine. Ferdinando was also a strong believer in metoposcopy, the art of deducing someone's personality from the pattern of the lines across someone forehead, and Ferdinando published a work on that topic.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1606 Magini published an extremely accurate set of trigonometric tables. This mathematical work is typical of all of Magini 's mathematical contributions which are all highly practical; contributions include treatises on the geometry of the sphere, on applications of trigonometry, and on calculating devices of Ferdinando own invention. Ferdinando had triumphed over Galileo in the competition for the chair at Bologna but Ferdinando also strongly opposed Galileo 's views [11]:-\n",
      "During the Easter holidays of 1610, Galileo stopped in Bologna on Ferdinando way from Padua to Florence to stay at the house of Ferdinando colleague Giovanni Antonio Magini .... Many in Bologna , including Magini , were sceptical of Galileo 's discoveries, and therefore an opportunity presented opportunity for a demonstration. In the presence of a number of learned men, Galileo showed Ferdinando telescope and let others observe earthly and celestial things through Galileo . others agreed that for earthly objects the instrument performed as promised but that in the heavens Galileo was not reliable.The reason the telescope was believed to be unreliable was that when telescope was turned on certain stars stars appeared as double and another star was seen to have four small stars nearby.\n",
      "\n",
      "Magini was also interested in mirrors, both in stars theory, publishing a treatise on the theory of concave spherical mirrors, and in stars practical manufacture. Ferdinando presented large concave spherical mirrors to Jacopo Boncompagni (son of Pope Gregory XIII and Prince of Sora), to Cardinal Alessandro Farnese (son Pier Luigi Farnese, Duke of Parma), and to the Holy Roman Emperor Rudolf II. The Duke of Mantua paid Farnese a handsome sum for one of the mirrors but there was a long battle between Magini and Rudolf II since Magini felt Farnese had been promised payment for the mirror which Farnese did not receive.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have not yet mentioned the work for which Magini is best known namely Farnese map of Italy. On 15 March 1595 Magini published a map of the Bologna region and wrote in the dedication (see for example [4]):-\n",
      "Inasmuch as I desire to publish a complete atlas of Italy , showing, besides the provinces, the territories of each city, I have decided to publish first this map of the territory of Bologna ...Let us quote from [4] which provides a good summary of how Magini 's map of Italy developed from that point:-\n",
      "[The Bologna map] was soon followed by other maps, and in two years Farnese had the greater part of the maps of North Italy already engraved, and some of maps published. maps were apparently sold separately and are extremely rare in this Italy ; for, being unable to obtain material for Farnese maps of Southern Italy, Farnese started correcting and revising what Farnese had already done, publishing a new map of the territory of Bologna in two sheets in 1599. At last, in 1602, Farnese received materials for the formation of the maps of the kingdom of Naples; and in 1604 nearly the whole atlas was ready, and an index of atlas appeared in the Latin edition of Farnese astronomical work, the 'Tavole del Primo Mobile'. But now Farnese was unable to obtain engravers, owing to a series of misfortunes, and began a lengthy descriptive commentary which was to accompany the maps , but which was never published, and is for the most part lost. At last, in 1607, Farnese secured the services of one Benjamin Wright, who, in the following year, engraved for Farnese a large map of Italy in six sheets. Wright , however, was something of a drunkard, and pawned several of the plates which Wright had done: and it was only in 1613 that the engraving of the plates was finished, after a good deal of further revision. The printing at last began in Bologna at the end of 1616; but Magini's death delayed the appearance of the work until 1620, when Wright son Fabio, who was not fifteen when Wright father died, finally brought son out. Wright dedicated son to Ferdinando Gonzaga, a member of the ducal family of Mantua, with which Giovanni had been in close personal relations, and who indeed had procured Giovanni a great deal of manuscript material from the governments of the various Bologna of Italy.Almagià, in [1], argues that Magini 's maps made a considerable contribution to modern geography:-\n",
      "Previous errors both in latitude and longitude are reduced; the political boundaries and physical features are far better indicated than ever before; and a number of names have been added. It was indeed a long time before Magini 's work was superseded.Finally, let us note that one of the main sources of biographical information about Magini is Giovanni correspondence with leading scientists which was edited and published by Antonio Favaro in 1886 (see [3]).\n"

    "text = f\"\"\"Michael Mästlin was born in Göppingen which was a village about 50 km east of Tübingen. Mästlin father, Jakob Mästlin, and Mästlin mother, Dorothea Simon, were both devout Lutherans and Michael was brought up in that faith and remained strongly committed to father throughout Mästlin life. Mästlin was the middle child of the family, having an older sister and a younger brother. Mästlin attended the monastic school in Königsbronn then, after Mästlin studies there, entered Tübingen University in 1568. [3]:-\n",
    "As was the case with many young scholars including Kepler, Mästlin most famous student, [Mästlin ] did Mästlin undergraduate studies at a preparatory school and came to the university to take Mästlin final exams and pick up Mästlin baccalaureate degree.At Tübingen University Mästlin studied mathematics and astronomy for a Master's degree under Philipp Apian who was Peter Apian's son. In 1570, while a student, Mästlin purchased a copy of Copernicus's De revolutionibus from the widow of Victorin Strigel, who had been professor of theology at Leipzig and the author of an astronomy text. Mästlin was awarded a Master 's degree with distinction in 1571. While studying for this degree Mästlin had edited a new edition of the Prutenis Tables which was published in 1571. The Prutenis Tables had been originally compiled by Erasmus Reinhold who had based 1571 on Copernicus's version of the solar system. After graduating, Mästlin spent the following years teaching in Tübingen, and at the same time took [3]:-\n",
    "... the theological programme, because Tübingen University's primary mission was to prepare young men for the Lutheran ministry.Then, in 1576, Mästlin was sent to be a deacon at the Lutheran Church in Backnang, a town about 30 km northwest of Göppingen. Mästlin married Margarete Gruuninger (1551-1588) in April 1577 not long after Mästlin took up the position in Backnang ; 1551 had three sons and three daughters but Margarete died due to complications with the birth of 1551 sixth child. Mästlin then married Margarete Burkhardt, daughter of a professor at Tübingen; 1551 had eight children.\n",
    "Mästlin is famous for Mästlin excellent, very accurate, observations of the comet of 1577, observed while Mästlin was in Backnang, and published in Tübingen in 1578 as Observatio et demonstratio cometae aetherae qui anno 1577 et 1578 constitutus in sphaera Veneris apparuit cum admirandius eius passionibus varietate scilicet motus loco orbe distantia a terro centro etc. adhibitis demonstrationibus geometricis et calculo arithmetico cuius modi de alio quoquam cometa nunquam visa est (Observations and demonstrations of the ethereal comets of the years 1577 and 1578). We discuss this achievement in more detail below. Mästlin remained in Backnang for four years, then was appointed as professor of mathematics at the University of Heidelberg in 1580. There Mästlin published the first edition of Mästlin famous astronomy textbook Epitome astronomiae (1582) - Mästlin published six further editions of this popular work during Mästlin lifetime. Despite Mästlin commitment to the views of Copernicus (which we state below in Mästlin own words) this teaching textbook was written purely as a description of astronomy based on the geocentric model of Ptolemy.\n",
    "After four years in Heidelberg Mästlin returned to Mästlin position in Tübingen where Mästlin spent the rest of Mästlin career [2]:-\n",
    "At Tübingen , Mästlin was elected dean of the arts faculty several times. Mästlin was well liked by both Mästlin colleagues and Mästlin students. Mästlin was very generous both to Mästlin family and to others. Mästlin was a religious man; Mästlin followed the Lutheran line in opposing the Gregorian calendar reform partly because man was initiated by the Pope. Mästlin had several students who became noted mathematicians, the most famous being Kepler. Mästlin also maintained interests in Biblical chronology and geography.Perhaps Mästlin greatest achievement (other than being Kepler 's teacher) is that Mästlin was the first to compute the orbit of a comet, although Mästlin method was not sound. Mästlin found, however, a sun centred orbit for the comet of 1577 which Mästlin claimed supported Copernicus's heliocentric system. Mästlin did show that the comet was further away than the moon, which contradicted the accepted teachings of Aristotle. Although clearly believing in the system as proposed by Copernicus , Mästlin taught astronomy using Mästlin own textbook which was based on Ptolemy's system. However for the more advanced lectures Mästlin adopted the heliocentric approach - Kepler credited Mästlin with introducing Mästlin to Copernican ideas while Mästlin was a student at Tübingen (1589-94). In [6] Methuen looks at these two different world systems in Mästlin 's teaching. A G Molland reviews Methuen 's paper:-\n",
    "Michael Mästlin is regularly ascribed a firm if minor place in accounts of the Astronomical Revolution, as the teacher of Johannes Kepler and as an early believer in the physical reality of the Copernican system. What has been less clear is how this related to Kepler regular teaching at the University of Tübingen, with some having argued that Kepler only taught Copernicanism cautiously and in private. Methuen examines this question in the light of Maestlin's published writings, including five sets of theses over whose disputations (two at Heidelberg, one at Tübingen ) Kepler presided. believer shows that Kepler had no compunction about firmly asserting the supralunar position of the New Star of 1572 and of the comets of 1577 - 1578 and 1580. In general, Kepler writings, especially Kepler textbook 'Epitome astronomiae' of 1582, show no firm Copernican commitment, although there are signs of a leaning in that direction, and Kepler was concerned with emphasizing the interconvertibility of hypotheses. Kepler elementary teaching was certainly based on traditional astronomy, but Methuen concludes that Kepler taught newer material to Kepler more advanced students. Methuen claims that Kepler made a clear distinction between \"spheres\" and \"orbs\", with the former possessing physical reality and the latter being merely useful mathematical constructions ...Mästlin was both a great expert on spherical trigonometry and also a fine observer producing accurate data - the quality of Mästlin eyesight is seen from the fact that Mästlin saw, and sketched the positions of, 11 stars in the Pleiades cluster. Of course there were not any bright city lights around then, but we challenge any reader to equal this achievement however dark a site reader find. Mästlin seems to have been the first to claim that the dark part of the moon shone through sunlight reflected from the earth but Leonardo da Vinci has also been credited with this idea. Another first for Mästlin is an accurate calculation of the golden ratio as \"approximately 0.6180340\" stated in a letter Mästlin wrote to Kepler in 1597.\n",
    "Mästlin was an innovative thinker who was quite prepared to challenge conventional views. For example Mästlin attempted to measure the parallax of a supernova and, having failed to find any, deduced that supernova was as far away as the \"fixed stars\". This of course contradicted the view, held since Aristotle, that all changes in the heavens occurred closer to earth than the realm of the stars which was unchanging.\n",
    "Mästlin lived to see the invention of the telescope for astronomical observations by Galileo. Mästlin had two, rather poor, telescopes with which Mästlin was able to observe sunspots and the moons of Jupiter. Mästlin was still making accurate observations at the age of 78 when Mästlin observed the lunar eclipse of 1628.\n",
    "As we mentioned above Mästlin acquired a copy of Copernicus's De revolutionibus in 1570 and Mästlin wrote extensive notes near the beginning of the book. These give much insight into Mästlin views on Copernicus and we quote the notes using Gingerich's translations. Mästlin wrote that [3]:-\n",
    "... the arrangement presented in this book is the sort of structure in which all the sidereal motions and phenomena are explained very exactly. Therefore this hypothesis recommends hypothesis to the intellect.Mästlin continued:-\n",
    "The heavenly motions were at the point of collapse, and so [Copernicus] concluded that appropriate hypotheses were needed to explain these motions . When Mästlin noticed that the common hypotheses were insufficient, Mästlin eventually accepted the idea of the Earth's mobility, since indeed, idea not only satisfied the phenomena very well but idea didn't lead to anything absurd.\n",
    "In fact, if anyone would straighten out the common hypotheses so that hypotheses would agree with the phenomena and allow no inconsistencies, then I would gratefully trust Mästlin ; clearly Mästlin would bring very many to Mästlin views. But I see that some, even very outstanding mathematicians, have laboured on this yet, in the end, without results. Therefore, I think that unless the common hypotheses are reformed (a task that I am not up to because of my inadequate abilities), I will accept the hypotheses and opinion of Copernicus - after Ptolemy, the prince of all Astronomers.There are further annotations written by Mästlin [3] which are very interesting. On the back of the title page of De revolutionibus is the infamous notice which states that \"... these hypotheses need not be true nor even probable; it is sufficient if the calculations agree with the observations.\" Mästlin adds a note to Mästlin copy stating:- \n",
    "This preface was added by someone, whoever preface author may be, (for indeed, preface weakness of style and choice of words reveal that preface is not by Copernicus).He later added a further note:-\n",
    "I found the following words written somewhere among the books of Philipp Apian (which I bought from Apian widow); although no author was given I could recognise Apian 's hand:\n",
    "On account of this letter Georg Joachim Rheticus, the Leipzig professor and disciple of Copernicus, became involved in a very bitter wrangle with the printer, who asserted that wrangle had been turned over to Rheticus with the rest of the work. Rheticus , however, suspected that Osiander [the proof-reader of Copernicus 's book] had prefaced Copernicus to the work . If professor knew this for certain, professor declared, professor would handle that fellow so that in future professor would mind professor own business and not slander astronomers any more. Nevertheless, [Peter] Apian told me that Osiander had openly admitted to professor that professor had added this all by professor .\n",
