It is a little unclear whether al-Banna was born in the city of Marrakesh or whether it was the region of Marrakesh which was named Morocco by Europeans. There is a claim that al-Banna was born in Granada in Spain and moved to North Africa for his education. What is certain is that he spent most of his life in Morocco.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nThe Marinids tribe were allies of the Umayyad caliphs of Córdoba. The tribe lived in eastern Morocco then, under their ruler Abu Yahya, they began to conquer the region. The Marinids captured Fez in <span class=\"non-italic\">1248</span> and made it their capital. They captured Marrakesh from the ruling Almohads tribe in <span class=\"non-italic\">1269</span>, thus taking control of the whole of Morocco. Having conquered Morocco, the Marinids tried to help Granada to prevent the Christian advance through their country. The strong link between Granada and Morocco may account for the confusion as to which country al-Banna was a native.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nMorocco was certainly the country that al-Banna was educated in, learning the leading mathematical skills of the period. He studied geometry in general, and <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Euclid/popup/\" href=\"../Euclid/\">Euclid</a>\\'s <em>Elements</em> in particular. He also studied fractional numbers and learnt much of the impressive contributions that the Arabs had made to mathematics over the preceding <span class=\"non-italic\">400</span> years. The Marinids had a strong culture for learning and Fez became their centre of learning. At the university in Fez Al-Banna taught all branches of mathematics, which at this time included arithmetic, algebra, geometry and astronomy. Fez was a thriving city with a new quarter being built housing the Royal Palace and the adjoining Great Mosque. Many students studied under al-Banna in this thriving academic community.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nIt is clear that al-Banna wrote a large number of works, in fact <span class=\"non-italic\">82</span> are listed by Renaud <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>see for example <span><span class=\"non-italic\">[</span><a class=\"reference\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;H P J Renaud, Ibn al-Banna de Marrakech, sufi et mathématicien, &lt;em&gt;Hesperis&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;25&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;(1938)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;13&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;\" href=\"#reference-9\"><span class=\"non-italic\">9</span></a><span class=\"non-italic\">]</span></span><span class=\"non-italic\">)</span>. Not all are on mathematics, but the mathematical texts included an introduction to <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Euclid/popup/\" href=\"../Euclid/\">Euclid</a>\\'s <em>Elements</em>, an algebra text and various works on astronomy. One difficulty with the works on mathematics is knowing how much of the material which al-Banna presents is original and how much is simply his version of work by earlier Arab mathematicians which has been lost. We should certainly say that al-Banna does not claim any originality and, indeed, the style of his writing would suggest that he is collecting together ideas that he has learnt from other mathematicians.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nTwo \"firsts\" for al-Banna are that he seems to have been the first to consider a fraction as a ratio between two numbers <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>see <span><span class=\"non-italic\">[</span><a class=\"reference\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;M Zarruqi, Fractions in the Morroccan mathematical tradition between the &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;th and &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;15&lt;/span&gt;th centuries A.D. as found in anonymous manuscripts &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Arabic&lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, in &lt;em&gt;Deuxième Colloque Maghrebin sur l\\'Histoire des Mathématiques Arabes&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Tunis, &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;1990)&lt;/span&gt;, A&lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;97&lt;/span&gt;-A&lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;109&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;\" href=\"#reference-12\"><span class=\"non-italic\">12</span></a><span class=\"non-italic\">]</span></span> for more details<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> and he is the first to use the expression almanakc <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>in Arabic al-manakh meaning weather<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> in a work containing astronomical and meteorological data.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nPerhaps al-Banna\\'s most famous work is <em>Talkhis amal al-hisab</em> <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>Summary of arithmetical operations<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> and the <em>Raf al-Hijab</em> which is al-Banna\\'s own commentary on the <em>Talkhis amal al-hisab</em>. It is in this work that al-Banna introduces some mathematical notation which has led certain authors to believe that algebraic symbolism was first developed in Islam by ibn al-Banna and <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Qalasadi/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Qalasadi/\">al-Qalasadi</a> <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>see for example <span><span class=\"non-italic\">[</span><a class=\"reference\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;G Arrighi, Review of some mathematical symbols &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;Italian&lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Physis - Riv.

We refer the reader to the biography of <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Qalasadi/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Qalasadi/\">al-Qalasadi</a> where we present arguments to show that neither al-Banna nor <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Qalasadi/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Qalasadi/\">al-Qalasadi</a> were the inventors of mathematical notation.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nThere are, however, many interesting mathematical ideas and results which appear in the <em>Raf al-Hijab</em>. For example it contains <a class=\"gllink\" data-popup=\"../../Glossary/continued_fraction/\" href=\"../../Glossary/#continued_fraction\">continued fractions</a> and they are used to compute approximate square roots. Other interesting results on summing series are the results\\n<div class=\"indent-paragraph\"><span class=\"math\"><span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math

Ismail Sabry and Souad Ahmed Mahmoud. She studied at Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, where she was awarded the degree of Bachelor of Science in <span class=\"non-italic\">1972</span>. She was then employed as a demonstrator at the Women\\'s College in Cairo.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nOn <span class=\"non-italic\">21</span> February <span class=\"non-italic\">1974</span> she married Hussein Abdel Wahab Abdel Gawad. They had three children, Assmaa Ismail, Ayman Ismail and Ihab Ismail. She continued to study for a Master of Science Degree and for this degree she wrote the thesis <em>Numerical treatment of systems of linear equations</em> which she submitted to Ain Shams University in February <span class=\"non-italic\">1976</span> as partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree. She gives the following Acknowledgements for the help she received:-\\n<blockquote>The author is greatly indebted to Professor Dr Abbas I Abdel Karim, Professor of Mathematics and Head of Department, University College of Women, Ain Shams University for suggesting the topic of this thesis, for his helpful guidance and kind advice throughout the supervision of this research work. Sincere thanks are expressed to Prof Dr M S El Mohandis, Professor of Mathematics, University College of Women, for his kind help and encouragement.</blockquote>\\nLet us quote the beginning of the Summary of the thesis:-\\n<blockquote>This thesis contains five main chapters. The first chapter is considered as fundamental for solving sets of linear simultaneous equations. The most important problem of numerical algebra is the development of algorithms for the solution. Essentially there are two reasons why this is such a basic problem. First of all, today nearly every linear problem in applied mathematics - as a boundary value problem for a linear ordinary or partial differential equation is reduced by appropriate techniques to a system of linear equations, especially when electronic computers are to be employed for its solution. Secondly, nonlinear problems can in most cases be solved by approximating them by linear problems. There are several different methods for the solution of sets of equations, the method used depending on the calculating aids available, the type of equations to be solved and the accuracy required in the solution. In general, there are two type of numerical techniques for solving simultaneous linear equations: direct methods, which are finite, and indirect methods which are infinite. The two methods are useful, both have advantages and limitations.</blockquote>\\nAfter being awarded a Master of Science Degree, Ismail was appointed as an assistant lecturer in mathematics at Ain Shams University in <span class=\"non-italic\">1976</span>. She continued to undertake research for a doctorate advised by Abbas I A Karim and in <span class=\"non-italic\">1983</span> they published the joint paper <em>The stability of multistep formulae for solving differential equations</em>. The authors give the following Abstract <span><span class=\"non-italic\">[</span><a class=\"reference\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;A I A Karim and G A Ismail, The stability of multistep formulae for solving differential equations, &lt;em&gt;Internat.

It is advantageous to state alternative methods for investigating the stability of multi-step formulae. Among these methods are: determination of the characteristic roots, graphical method, Hermitian form obtained from the characteristic equation or from the multi-step formula, application of Newton\\'s theorem and using Sturm\\'s theorem. The stability of an illustrative formula is discussed by using each of these methods.</blockquote>\\nIsmail was awarded a Ph.D. in <span class=\"non-italic\">1985</span> for her thesis <em>Accuracy of the multi-step methods for solving differential equations</em>. This work was not published. She was promoted from assistant lecturer to lecturer in mathematics. No papers by Ismail appear to have been published for ten years after the award of her thesis, but in <span class=\"non-italic\">1995</span> she was promoted to associate professor and appointed as manager of the Computer Unit at the Women\\'s College of Ain Shams University. Her next publication, a joint paper with Iman H Ibrahim, was <em>Variable step stiffly stable methods </em>which appeared in <span class=\"non-italic\">1996</span>. A paper with the same authors and title was published two years later in which the Introduction begins as follows <span><span class=\"non-italic\">[</span><a class=\"reference\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;G A F Ismail and I H Ibrahim, Variable step stiffly stable methods, &lt;em&gt;Int.

Stiffly stable variable step methods of order <span class=\"non-italic\">3</span> and <span class=\"non-italic\">4</span> are established. Some stability  properties of multistep formulas will be discussed, some theorems and lemmas are proved ...</blockquote>\\nFurther papers by Ismail followed: <em>A new higher order effective P-C methods for stiff systems</em> <span class=\"non-italic\">(1998)</span>; <em>Stability of nonequidistant variable order multistep methods for stiff systems</em> <span class=\"non-italic\">(2000)</span>; <em>A numerical technique for the <span class=\"non-italic\">3</span>-D Poisson equation</em> <span class=\"non-italic\">(2003)</span>, <em>Efficient numerical solution of <span class=\"non-italic\">3</span>D incompressible viscous Navier-Stokes equations</em> <span class=\"non-italic\">(2004)</span> and <em>A new approach to construct linear multistep formulae for solving stiff ODEs </em><span class=\"non-italic\">(2005)</span>.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nAlso in <span class=\"non-italic\">2005</span> Ismail published <em>Modified technique for solving advance-delay differential systems</em> in the journal <em>Mathematical and computer modelling</em>. This was unfortunate for, in the following year, the Editor-in-Chief of <em>Mathematical and computer modelling</em> requested the paper be retracted. We quote the following reason for the retraction given in this paper <span><span class=\"non-italic\">[</span><a class=\"reference\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;G A F Ismail, Erratum to: &quot;Modified technique for solving advance-delay differential systems\\'\\' &lt;span class=&quot;non-italic&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;Math.

In fact de Prony\\'s younger brother was always known by the name Riche. De Prony was educated at the Benedictine College at Toissei in Doubs. From there he entered the École des Ponts et Chaussés in <span class=\"non-italic\">1776</span> where he studied engineering. He graduated in <span class=\"non-italic\">1779</span> as the top student and remained for a further year in Paris, doing as the head of the École des Ponts et Chaussés told him:-\\n<blockquote>M de Prony ... concern yourself with acquiring a deep knowledge of your art, for you are destined to become head of the École des Ponts et Chaussés.</blockquote>\\nIn <span class=\"non-italic\">1780</span> he became an engineer with the École des Ponts et Chaussés and after three years in a number of different regions of France he returned to the École des Ponts et Chaussés in Paris <span class=\"non-italic\">1783</span>. This was the same year he published his first major work in the <a class=\"aclink\" href=\"../../Societies/Paris/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Académie des Sciences</a> on the forces on arches. <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Monge/popup/\" href=\"../Monge/\">Monge</a> was impressed with this paper and realised that de Prony was someone of great potential.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nIn <span class=\"non-italic\">1785</span> de Prony visited England on a project to obtain an accurate measurement of the relative positions of the Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory. Two years later he was promoted to inspector at the École des Ponts et Chaussés. Around this time he was involved with the work on the Louis XVI Bridge in Paris which is now called the Pont de la Concorde.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nFurther promotion in <span class=\"non-italic\">1790</span> was followed the next year by his being appointed Engineer-in-Chief of the École des Ponts et Chaussés. This promotion was as a result of the opening of the Louis XVI Bridge.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nAlso around <span class=\"non-italic\">1791</span> de Prony was working on geometry with <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Girard_Pierre/popup/\" href=\"../Girard_Pierre/\">Pierre Girard</a>. Then in <span class=\"non-italic\">1792</span>, de Prony began a major task of producing logarithmic and trigonometric tables, the <em>Cadastre</em>. With the assistance of <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Legendre/popup/\" href=\"../Legendre/\">Legendre</a>, <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Carnot/popup/\" href=\"../Carnot/\">Carnot</a> and other mathematicians, and between <span class=\"non-italic\">70</span> to <span class=\"non-italic\">80</span> assistants, the work was undertaken over a period of years, being completed in <span class=\"non-italic\">1801</span>.

Each copy consisted of eighteen folio volumes together with another volume of mathematical procedures.</blockquote>\\nGetting such a massive work published was another matter. Negotiations went on over a number of years until, in <span class=\"non-italic\">1809</span>, it seemed they would appear. The publisher wrote:-\\n<blockquote>The present generation would never have witnessed the end of this monumental work if M de Prony had not had the fortunate idea of applying the powerful method of division of labour, conceiving methods to reduce the long and laborious part of the production of the tables to simple additions and subtractions...</blockquote>\\nHowever the tables were never published in full and it was near the end of the century before even a part appeared. It was just too expensive to print at a time when France was not in the best of financial states.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nIn <span class=\"non-italic\">1794</span> the École Centrale des Travaux Publics was founded by and was directed by <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Carnot/popup/\" href=\"../Carnot/\">Carnot</a> and <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Monge/popup/\" href=\"../Monge/\">Monge</a>. It was renamed the École Polytechnique in <span class=\"non-italic\">1795</span> and de Prony was certainly one of the main lectures by this time. He is listed among the first teachers at the university as:-\\n<blockquote>Prony, lecturer in analysis, director of the Cadastre, member of the Institute.

It did mean that de Prony was to fail to receive the honours he deserved from Napoleon but de Prony\\'s wife was a close friend of Joséphine and this probably saved de Prony from anything worse.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nIn <span class=\"non-italic\">1798</span> de Prony achieved his ambition of being appointed director of the École des Ponts et Chaussés. His desire for this post was almost certainly a main reason for his refusing to join Napoleon. As director he began producing a number of important texts on mathematical physics. He became a member of the Bureau de Longitude and, in <span class=\"non-italic\">1810</span> and <span class=\"non-italic\">1811</span>, he produced two further major texts from his lectures at the École Polytechnique, namely <em>Leçons de Mécanique Analytique</em> <span><a class=\"translation nonoscript non-italic\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;Lessons on analytical mechanics&lt;/span&gt;\">Ⓣ</a><noscript><span class=\"non-italic\">(</span><span class=\"markup\">Lessons on analytical mechanics</span><span class=\"non-italic\">)</span></noscript></span> and <em>Sommaire des Leçons du Cours de Mécanique</em> <span><a class=\"translation nonoscript non-italic\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;Summary of lessons in a course on mechanics&lt;/span&gt;\">Ⓣ</a><noscript><span class=\"non-italic\">(</span><span class=\"markup\">Summary of lessons in a course on mechanics</span><span class=\"non-italic\">)</span></noscript></span>.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nAfter Napoleon was defeated the reorganisation in France included a reorganisation of the École Polytechnique which was closed during <span class=\"non-italic\">1816</span>. De Prony lost his position as professor there and was not part of the reorganisation committee. However, as soon as the school reopened, de Prony was asked to be an examiner so he continued his connection yet only had to work one month per year.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nOne of de Prony\\'s most important scientific inventions was the \\'de Prony brake\\' which he invented in <span class=\"non-italic\">1821</span> to measure the performance of machines and engines. It was based on ideas of <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Hachette/popup/\" href=\"../Hachette/\">Hachette</a> and was a considerable improvement on a method which <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Girard_Pierre/popup/\" href=\"../Girard_Pierre/\">Pierre Girard</a> had used two years earlier.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nThe last part of de Prony\\'s career was more involved with education rather than administration. One battle he fought, without success, was against <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Cauchy/popup/\" href=\"../Cauchy/\">Cauchy</a>\\'s move towards pure mathematics and away from the more applied mathematics which de Prony firmly believed in.

<span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>or <strong>al-Kalasadi,</strong> as it is sometimes written<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> was born in Bastah, a Moorish city in Andalusia, now a part of Spain. Andalusia was derived from the Arabic name al-Andalus which was originally applied by the Muslims to the whole of present day Spain and Portugal, an area which they occupied from the <span class=\"non-italic\">8</span><span class=\"superscript\">th</span>  Century. In the <span class=\"non-italic\">11</span><span class=\"superscript\">th</span>  Century Christians began to retake the area, slowly moving down from the north and east. Andalusia was then the name applied to the region remaining under Muslim rule.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nThe Christian reconquest took four hundred years. Andalusia had prospered during the <span class=\"non-italic\">13</span><span class=\"superscript\">th</span>  century and the Alhambra, a wonderful palace and fortress of the rulers of Granada, was largely completed by <span class=\"non-italic\">1360</span>. The Christian kingdom of Castile to the north had suffered civil strife through the <span class=\"non-italic\">14</span><span class=\"superscript\">th</span>  Century, so Andalusia had prospered but, in <span class=\"non-italic\">1407</span>, five years before al-Qalasadi was born, Castile began a major push to conquer the whole of Spain and Portugal.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nAl-Qalasadi was a Muslim who was brought up in Bastah which is north-east of Granada city. It must have been a difficult period in which to live in Bastah, with a steady, yet intermittent, encroachment of Castile towards the city. Al-Qalasadi began his education in Bastah, studying law, the Qur\\'an and the science of fixed shares in an estate. He moved south, away from the war zone, to Granada where he continued his studies, in particular philosophy, science and Muslim law.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nAl-Qalasadi chose to remain in the Islamic world and he left Granada and travelled widely throughout Islamic territory. In particular he spent much time in the North Africa, living in Islamic countries which had supported Andalusia, both with political and with military aid in its resistance to the Christian attacks. He spent some time in Tlemcen <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>now in northwestern Algeria, near the Moroccan border<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> where he studied under teachers who taught him arithmetic and its applications. Form there al-Qalasadi went to Egypt where again he studied with some of the leading scholars. Eventually al-Qalasadi reached Mecca, the purpose of his pilgrimage, and returned to Granada.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nThings were in a bad way when al-Qalasadi returned to Granada. The last remaining parts of the Muslim state were under severe attack from the Christians of Aragon and Castile. However, al-Qalasadi taught and wrote some of his major works during this period but eventually the advancing Christian armies made life impossible for him.

Some of these are commentaries such as his commentary on the <em>Talkhis amal al-hisab</em> <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>Summary of arithmetical operations<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> by <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Banna/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Banna/\">ibn al-Banna</a>. <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Banna/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Banna/\">Ibn al-Banna</a> was a Moroccan who had died over <span class=\"non-italic\">100</span> years before al-Qalasadi wrote his commentary but, perhaps surprisingly, <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Banna/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Banna/\">ibn al-Banna</a> himself had written a commentary on his own work.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nCertainly al-Qalasadi wrote original works. His major treatise was <em>al-Tabsira fi\\'lm al-hisab</em> <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>Clarification of the science of arithmetic<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span>. This was a difficult text and, perhaps to some extent following the example of <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Banna/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Banna/\">ibn al-Banna</a>, al-Qalasadi followed it up by writing a simpler version which he called <em>Unveiling the science of arithmetic</em>. Even this he must have considered to be too difficult to be used as a teaching book, for he wrote yet a third version <em>Unfolding the secrets of the use of dust letters</em>.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nThe title of this work needs some explanation. The early methods of calculating with Hindu numerals involved the use of a dust board. A dust board was used because the methods required the moving of numbers around in the calculation and rubbing some out as the calculation proceeded. The dust board allowed this in the same sort of way that one can use a blackboard, chalk and a blackboard eraser. However, <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Al-Uqlidisi/popup/\" href=\"../Al-Uqlidisi/\">al-Uqlidisi</a> in the tenth century had showed how to modify arithmetical techniques so that pen and paper could be used instead of the dust board.

The difficulty was that al-Qalasadi, being one of the last of the mathematicians associated with the major mathematical contributions by the Muslims and Arabs, was better known than many of the earlier contributors. Ignorance of the earlier contributions led historians to give too much credit to al-Qalasadi whom in many ways displayed the same characteristics as the later ancient Greek mathematicians.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nOnce established, however, ideas are harder to overturn than one might imagine.

Doppelmaier or Doppelmair. His father, Johann Siegmund Doppelmayr, was a merchant but had deep interests in science. Writing about his father later in his life, Doppelmayr explained how his hobby was carrying out experiments in physics. He was the first to introduce a vacuum air pump into Nuremberg.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nJohann Doppelmayr entered the Aegidien <a class=\"gllink\" data-popup=\"../../Glossary/gymnasium/\" href=\"../../Glossary/#gymnasium\">Gymnasium</a> in Nuremberg in <span class=\"non-italic\">1689</span>. The Aegidien Gymnasium had been founded in the <span class=\"non-italic\">16</span><span class=\"superscript\">th</span>  century by the Swiss Protestant reformer Ulrich Zwingli. Doppelmayr was to return to this Gymnasium as a professor later in his career. From Nuremberg, Doppelmayr went to the University of Altdorf in <span class=\"non-italic\">1696</span> where he studied law, mathematics and natural philosophy. In <span class=\"non-italic\">1698</span> he completed a dissertation on the sun, then went on to attend lectures on mathematics and natural philosophy by Johann Christoph Sturm who was considered the leading experimental physicist in Germany at the time. Doppelmayr submitted his dissertation <em>De visionis sensu nobilissimo, ex camerae obscurae tenebris illustrato</em> <span><a class=\"translation nonoscript non-italic\" data-popup=\"&lt;span class=&quot;markup&quot;&gt;On the most noble visions illustrated with the \\'camera obscura\\'&lt;/span&gt;\">Ⓣ</a><noscript><span class=\"non-italic\">(</span><span class=\"markup\">On the most noble visions illustrated with the \\'camera obscura\\'</span><span class=\"non-italic\">)</span></noscript></span>  in <span class=\"non-italic\">1699</span>. For a short time in <span class=\"non-italic\">1700</span> he studied physics and mathematics at the University of Halle where he also learnt French and Italian, then spent two years travelling in Germany, Holland and England. Until his visit to the University of Halle he had kept his options open of making a career in law or in mathematics and physics, but in <span class=\"non-italic\">1700</span> he made the definite decision to give up his study of law and to concentrate on mathematics and science.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nFirst Doppelmayr went to Berlin in September <span class=\"non-italic\">1700</span> from where he moved on to Franeker and Amsterdam in Holland before arriving in Utrecht. There he spent two months, again studying mathematics and physics, but here also improving his language skills by studying English. From Utrecht, he moved on to Leiden in April <span class=\"non-italic\">1701</span> where he was welcomed by Lothar Zumbach von Koesfeld, the professor of astronomy, who invited him to live in his home during his visit. Doppelmayr made good use of his time, as he did in every place he visited, learning instrument making skills in Leiden such as how to make telescopes and how to grind lenses. Having quickly mastered these new skills, he moved on again, going this time to Rotterdam before crossing to England in May <span class=\"non-italic\">1701</span> where he visited Oxford and London. Before the end of <span class=\"non-italic\">1701</span> he was back in Holland, returning to Leiden for a five month visit to attend astronomy lectures by Lothar Zumbach von Koesfeld. Leaving Leiden he returned to Nuremberg but took a long route which involved visits to Utrecht, Deventer, Osnabrück, Hannover, Kassel, Marburg, Giessen, Wetzlar and Frankfurt. By August <span class=\"non-italic\">1702</span> he was back in Nuremberg having learnt  awide range of mathematical and scientific skills which at that time were not available in Germany.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nHe clearly made a good impression on people during these visits since he was later elected to membership of a number of scientific societies including the <a class=\"aclink\" href=\"../../Societies/Berlin/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Berlin Academy</a>, the <a class=\"aclink\" href=\"../../Societies/German_Academy/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">German Academy of Scientists Leopoldina</a> <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>the Kaiserlich Leopoldinische Akademie der Naturforscher<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> in Halle <span class=\"non-italic\">(1715)</span>, the <a class=\"aclink\" href=\"../../Societies/RS/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Society</a> <span class=\"non-italic\">(6</span> December <span class=\"non-italic\">1733)</span>, and the <a class=\"aclink\" href=\"../../Societies/Russian/\" rel=\"noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">St Petersburg Academy</a> <span class=\"non-italic\">(1740)</span>.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nDoppelmayr was appointed professor of mathematics at the Aegidien Gymnasium in Nuremberg in <span class=\"non-italic\">1704</span> and he remained there for the rest of his life. In February <span class=\"non-italic\">1716</span> he married Susanna Maria Kellner who was eighteen years old at the time <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>Doppelmayr was <span class=\"non-italic\">38</span> years old by this time<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span>. They had four children, although only one survived beyond infancy, and Susanna died at the age of <span class=\"non-italic\">31</span> in <span class=\"non-italic\">1728</span>. Although Doppelmayr was to remain at the Aegidien Gymnasium in Nuremberg for the rest of his life, this was very much his choice since he had opportunities to move to much more prestigious positions. In <span class=\"non-italic\">1723</span> he was honoured with the offer of the chair of mechanics at the Academy of St Petersburg. He turned down this offer, however, suggesting instead that <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Bernoulli_Nicolaus(II)/popup/\" href=\"../Bernoulli_Nicolaus(II)/\">Nicolaus <span class=\"non-italic\">(</span>II<span class=\"non-italic\">)</span> Bernoulli</a> be offered the post. Indeed <a class=\"mlink\" data-popup=\"../Bernoulli_Nicolaus(II)/popup/\" href=\"../Bernoulli_Nicolaus(II)/\">Bernoulli</a> did accept the chair at the Academy of St Petersburg.\\n<br/>\\n\\n<br/>\\nDoppelmayr wrote on astronomy, spherical trigonometry, sundials and mathematical instruments. He used his language skills to translate a number of texts on astronomy, geography and scientific instrument into German or Latin. For example he translated the English text <em>Astronomia Carolina: A New Theorie of the Coelestial Motions</em>  by Thomas Streete into Latin, publishing his translation of the <span class=\"non-italic\">1665</span> original in <span class=\"non-italic\">1705</span>.
